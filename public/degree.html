      <h1>My Degree</h1>
      <p>A computer science student typically studies programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, 
        along with foundational topics like algorithms, data structures, operating systems, and computer networks. 
        They develop expertise in software engineering, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity, 
        often exploring electives like cloud computing, blockchain, or game development. Students hone their 
        problem-solving skills, work collaboratively in teams, and use tools such as Git, VS Code, and cloud platforms 
        like AWS. Many participate in hackathons, contribute to tech clubs, or gain industry experience through internships. 
        Their projects range from mobile apps and websites to machine learning models and automation scripts. 
        Research opportunities allow them to delve into cutting-edge technologies. Upon graduation, they aspire to 
        roles like software developer, data scientist, AI/ML engineer, or cybersecurity analyst, equipped with a 
        strong foundation to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
