        <p class="description">
            <br>Informatic Engineering Foundations is an introduction to Computer Science and Computer Engineering.<br>It is the basis of the degree; it teaches the elemental contents that allow students to become good professionals and to obtain advanced knowledge in this field.<br>
            <br>But, how can we study a Computer Science degree without even knowing where computers came from?<br>              
            <br>First of all, it is necessary to delve into computer history and evolution.<br>Which was the first computer ever invented? How did it work? What things have changed so that we have such incredible computers nowadays?<br>                
            <br>To continue, the current context of Computer Science and Computer Engineering (both as a degree and a profession) is analyzed.<br>We have evolved from transforming materials, to transforming energy, and to end up transforming information.<br>
            <br>After this, referring directly to Informatic Engineering, computers as a whole are studied: their outside, hardware; their inside, software. Every electronic device nowadays has an Operating System (which is the most important part of the device's software) and connects to a network (LAN, WLAN, MAN, WAN).<br>                
            <br>Technology has constantly been changing in the last few years. What was innovative yesterday is not even useful anymore. That is why new trends and technological developments such as Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning are important to study.<br>
            <br>In order to understand how information is used and transformed, it is necessary to know the existing data formats. Information in binary, conversion from octal to decimal or hexadecimal are only some of the concepts to be seen.<br>
            <br>To end up, web programming is introduced.<br>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages that are studied, in order to learn how to use and manipulate them and to develop a webpage like this one.<br><br>
