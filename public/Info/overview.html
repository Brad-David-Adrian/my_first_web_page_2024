            <br>League of Legends is one of the most popular video games in the MOBA category.<br>
            <br>It was launched in 2009 by Riot Games and since then it has been one of the most influential<br>
            <br>games in pop culture.<br>
            
            <br>In the game, there are over 200 champions that the player can choose from. Each one has their<br>
            <br>unique playstyle and abilities, making it a difficult task to keep all of them balanced<br>
            <br>and fair for all players. This has been a constant issue for the developers of the game<br>
            <br>as they have to constantly update the game to keep it fair for all players.<br>

            <br>Another issue that the game has is the toxicity of the community. The game has a chat<br>
            <br>system that allows players to communicate with each other, but this has been a problem<br>
            <br>as many players use it to insult and harass other players. This has been a problem for<br>
            <br>the developers as they have to constantly ban players that are toxic to keep the game<br>
            <br>a safe and fun environment for all players.<br>

            <br>The game has also been criticized for the amount of microtransactions that it has.<br>
            <br>The game is free to play, but it has a lot of in-game purchases that can give the player<br>
            <br>an advantage over other players. This has been a problem for the developers as they have<br>
            <br>to keep the game fair for all players while still making money from the game.<br>
