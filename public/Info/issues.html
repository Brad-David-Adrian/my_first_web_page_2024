            <br>The main issue of League is its balancing team.<br>
            <br>The balancing team of League of Legends is a group of people<br> 
            <br>who are in charge of making sure that the game is fair and balanced.<br> 
            <br>They do this by making changes to the game<br>
            <br>such as nerfing or buffing champions, items, and other aspects of the game.<br>
            <br>However, the balancing team has been criticized for not doing a good job of balancing the game.<br>
            <br>Many players feel that certain champions are too strong or too weak<br>
            <br>and that the game is not fun to play as a result.<br>
            <br>Some players have even quit the game because of the balancing issues.<br>
            
            <br>Riot Games, the company that makes League of Legends,<br> 
            <br>has tried to address these concerns by making changes to the game,<br>
            <br>but many players feel that the balancing team is not doing enough to fix the problems.<br>
