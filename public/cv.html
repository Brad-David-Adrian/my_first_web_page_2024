                <br>The Computer Engineering curriculum combines principles of computer science and electrical engineering to prepare students for a versatile career.<br>
                <br>The program begins with foundational courses in programming, mathematics, and physics, covering topics such as calculus, discrete mathematics, and digital logic design.<br> 
                <br>Core courses include data structures and algorithms, computer organization and architecture, embedded systems, and operating systems.<br> 
                <br>Students gain hands-on experience in microprocessor programming, circuit analysis, and software development.<br> 
                <br>Advanced topics like machine learning, computer networks, and cybersecurity are introduced alongside electives such as robotics, IoT, or VLSI design.<br> 
                <br>Practical skills are reinforced through labs, internships, and team-based projects like building hardware prototypes or developing software solutions.<br> 
                <br>In their final year, students undertake a capstone project that integrates hardware and software to solve real-world problems.<br> 
                <br>This comprehensive curriculum equips graduates for careers in hardware design, embedded systems, software development, or further specialization in graduate studies.<br>
