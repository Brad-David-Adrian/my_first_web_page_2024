            The history of bullfighting can be traced back centuries, with its origins rooted in ancient <br>
            Mediterranean civilizations. While the modern form of bullfighting emerged in Spain, similar <br>
            practices were also present in Mesoamerica. Over time, the spectacle evolved from a ritualistic <br>
            activity to a public entertainment event. In the 18th and 19th centuries, bullfighting gained <br>
            widespread popularity and became a symbol of cultural identity in the Iberian Peninsula.<br>

            The traditional bullfight consists of three parts: the tercio de varas (lancing third), tercio <br>
            de banderillas (banderillas third), and tercio de muerte (death third). Each stage involves <br>
            specific rituals and maneuvers, showcasing the matador's skill and bravery.  <br>
