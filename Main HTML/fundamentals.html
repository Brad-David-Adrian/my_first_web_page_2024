        <h1><br>INFORMATIC ENGINEERING FOUNDATIONS</h1>
        <p class="description">
            <br>Informatic Engineering Foundations is an introduction to Computer Science and Computer Engineering.<br>It is the basis of the degree; it teaches the elemental contents that allow students to become good professionals and to obtain an advanced knowledge in this field.<br>
            <br>But, how can we study a Computer Science degree without even knowing where did computers come from?<br>              
            <br>First of all, it is needed to deepen into computer history and evolution.<br>Which was the first computer ever invented? How did it work? What things have changed so that we have so incredible computers nowadays?<br>                
            <br>To continue, the current context of Computer Science and of Computer Engineering (both as a degree and a profession) are analised.<br>We have evolved from transforming materials, to transforming energy and to end up tarnsforming information.<br>
            <br>After this, referring directly to Informatic Engineering, computers on its global are studied: their outside, hardware; their inside, software. Every electronic device has nowadays an Operating System (which is the most important part of the device's software) and connects to a network (LAN, WLAN, MAN, WAN).<br>                
            <br>Technology has constantly been changing in in the last few years. What yesterday was innovative, is not even useful anymore. That is why new trends and technological developments such as Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning are important to study.<br>
            <br>In order to understand how information is used and transformed, it is necessary to know the existing data formats. Information in binary, conversion from octal to decimal or hexadecimal are only some of the concepts to be seen.<br>
            <br>To end up, web programming is introduced.<br>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the languages that are studied, in order to learn how to use and manipulate them and to develop a webpage as this one.<br><br>
